\section{Long and Short Vowels}

English speakers usually think of the following pairs of vowels as being related
to each other by being ‘short’ and ‘long’. When vowel length is referred to
elsewhere in the rules, it is this colloquial meaning of length which is
intended, not the strict sense of length used in the field of phonetics which
applies to the pronunciation of languages such as German and classical Latin.
