\section{Magic \gr{e}}

\gr{e} at the end of a morpheme has the effect of lengthening the root vowel of
the morpheme in some scenarios. The rule is most applicable to morphemes and
words ending (C)VC\gr{e}; that is, a single vowel followed by a single consonant
followed by \gr{e}. It can also apply after certain consonant combinations which
are followed by \gr{e}; these will be treated separately. However, it
\emph{never} applies when the preceding is simply doubled: in this case it may
be silent (\eg{gramme, ville}) or, in some proper names and loanwords,
pronounced as \ph{i} (\eg{posse, Jesse}).

When morphemes are combined with words to which magic \gr{e} applies, the \gr{e}
is usually dropped (\eg{hate} and \eg{hating}, \eg{file} and \eg{filing}). When
morphemes are combined with words to which magic \gr{e} applies which end with a
single consonant, the final consonant is usually doubled to maintain the
shortness of the root vowel (\eg{shop} and \eg{shopping}), except where the
consonant is \gr{v}, in which case the vowel length is ambiguous (\eg{give} and
\eg{giving}, compare \eg{driving}).

In the exceptions list below, only words whose \emph{only} spelling defect is an
erroneous \gr{e} which appears to, but which actually does not, lengthen its
preceding vowel. \eg{come}, for instance, would be incorrectly pronounced
\ph{koUm} if we are to trust its spelling, but without the \gr{e} it would be
the equally incorrect pronunciation \ph{k6m}.

\begin{exceptions}{Words where final \gr{e} is not magic}
\item have
\item give
\item opposite (compare \eg{termite, socialite}, etc.)
\item practise, practice
\item any Latin-derived term ending \gr{ive} (compare \gr{ize} and \gr{ise})
\end{exceptions}

The exceptions to the rule with unpredictable behaviour all have \gr{o} as their
root vowel, where a \gr{u} (with or without magic \gr{e}) would be expected:

\begin{exceptions}{Words where final \gr{e} has completely unpredictable behaviour, grouped by consonant and sound}
\item come, some (compare \eg{chrome, gnome, home,} etc.)
\item above, dove, glove, love, shove (compare \eg{drove, grove, Shrove, strove}, etc.)
\item improve, approve, move (see above)
\end{exceptions}
