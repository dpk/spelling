\section{Other Consonant Spellings}

\subsection{\gr{le}}

\gr{le} after a consonant at the end of a word makes the syllable \ph{@l}. It
effects magic \gr{e} (\eg{able, rifle, noble, bugle}) except for the vowel
\gr{e} (\eg{treble}), and except when preceded by a two consonants with shortening effect
(\eg{angle, puzzle, rabble, tickle}).

%% @@ check "except for the vowel e" (segle, redle, streble)

\subsubsection{\gr{nd}}

At the end of morphemes, \gr{i} is lengthened when followed by \gr{nd} (\eg{behind, bind,
find, kind, grind}; compare \eg{indicate, Hindu, cylinder, kindle}).

\begin{exceptions}{\gr{i} not lengthened by \gr{nd} at morpheme ending}
\item Amerind
\item wind
\end{exceptions}
