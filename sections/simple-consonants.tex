\section{Simple Consonants}

The consonants in English spelling are \gr{b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q,
r, s, t, v, x, z}. The semivowels \gr{w} and \gr{y} also act as consonants in some
contexts.

When they are alone between two vowels or at the beginning or end of a word, the
following consonants in English spelling correspond directly to their phonemic
IPA values: \gr{b, d, f, k, l, m, n, p, s, v}. \gr{h} also has this property
except at the end of words. In multigraphs, however, the values of some of these
can be altered as set out in other rules.

In addition, the following consonants standing alone or at the beginning or end
of a word also have simple phonemic correspondences:

\begin{tabular}{ l r }

\end{tabular}

The following digraphs also have standard correspondences to phonemes:

\begin{tabular}{l r}
\end{tabular}
